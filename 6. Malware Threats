----------------------Gain Access to the Target System using Trojans

create a Trojan using njRAT Trojan to gain control over a victim machine.



Use virus total for malware analysis 
SwayzCryptor.exe is used for encrypting the malware file which can't be detected by most of the antivirus 


Create a Trojan Server using Theef RAT Trojan


----------------------Infect the Target System using a Virus

	• In the Windows 11 machine, navigate to E:\CEH-Tools\CEHv12 Module 07 Malware Threats\Virus Maker\JPS Virus Maker and double-click jps.exe.

	• In this task, the options embedded in the virus file are Disable TaskManager, Disable Windows Update, Disable Control Panel, Disable Drives, Hide Windows Clock, Hide Desktop Icons, Enable Remote Desktop, Remove Bluetooth, Turn Off Windows Firewall, Turn Off Windows Defender, and Auto Startup.
	• Check the Change Windows Password option, and enter a password (here, qwerty) in the text field. Check the Change Computer Name option, and type Test in the text field.

	• Attackers often use packing and obfuscation or a packer to compress, encrypt, or modify a malware executable file to avoid detection. Obfuscation also hides the execution of the programs. When the user executes a packed program, it also runs a small wrapper program to decompress the packed file, and then runs the unpacked file. It complicates the task of reverse engineers to determine the actual program logic and other metadata via static analysis. The best approach is to try and identify if the file includes packed elements and locate the tool or method used to pack it.
