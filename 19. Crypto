The objective of the lab is to use encryption to conceal data and perform other tasks that include, but is not limited to:

	• Generate hashes and checksum files
	• Calculate the encrypted value of the selected file
	• Use encrypting/decrypting techniques
	• Perform file and data encryption
	• Create self-signed certificates
	• Perform email encryption
	• Perform disk encryption
	• Perform cryptanalysis
