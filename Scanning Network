	1. nmap -sn -PR [Target IP Address]
		a. -sn: disables port scan and -PR: performs ARP ping scan.
	2. nmap -sn -PU [Target IP Address]    =>  -PU: performs the UDP ping scan.
	3. nmap -sn -PE [Target IP Address]    =>   -PE: performs the ICMP ECHO ping scan.
	4. nmap -sn -PE 10.10.1.10-23
	5. nmap -sn -PP [Target IP Address]   => -PP: performs the ICMP timestamp ping scan.
	6. ICMP Address Mask Ping Scan: This technique is an alternative for the traditional ICMP ECHO ping scan, which are used to determine whether the target host is live specifically when administrators block the ICMP ECHO pings.
	# nmap -sn -PM [target IP address]
	7. TCP SYN Ping Scan: This technique sends empty TCP SYN packets to the target host, ACK response means that the host is active.
	# nmap -sn -PS [target IP address]
	8. TCP ACK Ping Scan: This technique sends empty TCP ACK packets to the target host; an RST response means that the host is active.
	# nmap -sn -PA [target IP address]
	9. IP Protocol Ping Scan: This technique sends different probe packets of different IP protocols to the target host, any response from any probe indicates that a host is active.
	# nmap -sn -PO [target IP address]

	• Banner grabbing, or OS fingerprinting, is a method used to determine the OS that is running on a remote target system.
	• There are two types of OS discovery or banner grabbing techniques:
	• Active Banner Grabbing Specially crafted packets are sent to the remote OS, and the responses are noted, which are then compared with a database to determine the OS. Responses from different OSes vary, because of differences in the TCP/IP stack implementation.
	• Passive Banner Grabbing This depends on the differential implementation of the stack and the various ways an OS responds to packets. Passive banner grabbing includes banner grabbing from error messages, sniffing the network traffic, and banner grabbing from page extensions.
	
	
	
		OS Discovery
	10. nmap -A [Target IP Address]     => -A: to perform an aggressive scan.
	11. nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse [Target IP Address]
	12.  unicornscan [Target IP Address] -Iv     => -I specifies an immediate mode and v specifies a verbose mode.

Techniques to evade IDS/firewall:

	• Packet Fragmentation: Send fragmented probe packets to the intended target, which re-assembles it after receiving all the fragments
	• Source Routing: Specifies the routing path for the malformed packet to reach the intended target
	• Source Port Manipulation: Manipulate the actual source port with the common source port to evade IDS/firewall
	• IP Address Decoy: Generate or manually specify IP addresses of the decoys so that the IDS/firewall cannot determine the actual IP address
	• IP Address Spoofing: Change source IP addresses so that the attack appears to be coming in as someone else
	• Creating Custom Packets: Send custom packets to scan the intended target beyond the firewalls
	• Randomizing Host Order: Scan the number of hosts in the target network in a random order to scan the intended target that is lying beyond the firewall
	• Sending Bad Checksums: Send the packets with bad or bogus TCP/UPD checksums to the intended target
	• Proxy Servers: Use a chain of proxy servers to hide the actual source of a scan and evade certain IDS/firewall restrictions
	• Anonymizers: Use anonymizers that allow them to bypass Internet censors and evade certain IDS and firewall rules

	1. nmap -f [Target IP Address],  => -f switch is used to split the IP packet into tiny fragment packets
	2. nmap -g 80 [Target IP Address]  =>  -g or --source-port option to perform source port manipulation.
	3. nmap -mtu 8 [Target IP Address]  =>   -mtu: specifies the number of Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) (here, 8 bytes of packets).
		a. Using MTU, smaller packets are transmitted instead of sending one complete packet at a time. This technique evades the filtering and detection mechanism enabled in the target machine.
	4. nmap -D RND:10 [Target IP Address]  => D: performs a decoy scan and RND: generates a random and non-reserved IP addresses (here, 10).
	5. nmap -sT -Pn --spoof-mac 0 [Target IP Address]  => --spoof-mac 0 represents randomizing the MAC address, -sT: performs the TCP connect/full open scan, -Pn is used to skip the host discovery.
		a. MAC address spoofing technique involves spoofing a MAC address with the MAC address of a legitimate user on the network. This technique allows you to send request packets to the targeted machine/network pretending to be a legitimate host.
	6. hping3 [Target IP Address] --udp --rand-source --data 500  => --udp specifies sending the UDP packets to the target host, --rand-source enables the random source mode and --data specifies the packet body size.
	7. hping3 -S [Target IP Address] -p 80 -c 5     => -S specifies the TCP SYN request on the target machine, -p specifies assigning the port to send the traffic, and -c is the count of the packets sent to the target machine.
	8.  hping3 [Target IP Address] --flood   => --flood: performs the TCP flooding.
	9.  NetScanTools Pro (https://www.netscantools.com), Colasoft packet builder (https://www.colasoft.com), etc. to build custom packets to evade security mechanisms.
	10.  hping3 --scan 0-100 -S [Target IP Address]  => --scan specifies the port range to scan, 0-100 specifies the range of ports to be scanned, and -S specifies setting the SYN flag.
	Entire subnet scan for live host: hping3 -1 [Target Subnet] --rand-dest -I eth0
	
	UDP scan: hping3 -2 [Target IP Address] -p 80 -c 5

	• IDLE/IPID Header Scan: A TCP port scan method that can be used to send a spoofed source address to a computer to discover what services are available.
	# nmap -sI -v [target IP address]

	• SCTP INIT Scan: An INIT chunk is sent to the target host; an INIT+ACK chunk response implies that the port is open, and an ABORT Chunk response means that the port is closed.
	# nmap -sY -v [target IP address]

	• SCTP COOKIE ECHO Scan: A COOKIE ECHO chunk is sent to the target host; no response implies that the port is open and ABORT Chunk response means that the port is closed.
