There are several different types of Wi-Fi attacks that attackers use to eavesdrop on wireless network connections in order to obtain sensitive information such as passwords, banking credentials, and medical records, as well as to spread malware.

These include:

	• Fragmentation attack: When successful, such attacks can obtain 1,500 bytes of PRGA (pseudo random generation algorithm)
	• MAC spoofing attack: The attacker changes their MAC address to that of an authenticated user in order to bypass the access point’s MAC-filtering configuration
	• Disassociation attack: The attacker makes the victim unavailable to other wireless devices by destroying the connectivity between the access point and client
	• Deauthentication attack: The attacker floods station(s) with forged deauthentication packets to disconnect users from an access point
	• Man-in-the-middle attack: An active Internet attack in which the attacker attempts to intercept, read, or alter information between two computers
	• Wireless ARP poisoning attack: An attack technique that exploits the lack of a verification mechanism in the ARP protocol by corrupting the ARP cache maintained by the OS in order to associate the attacker’s MAC address with the target host
	• Rogue access points: Wireless access points that an attacker installs on a network without authorization and that are not under the management of the network administrator
	• Evil twin: A fraudulent wireless access point that pretends to be a legitimate access point by imitating another network name
	• Wi-Jacking attack: A method used by attackers to gain access to an enormous number of wireless networks



aircrack-ng '/home/attacker/Desktop/Sample Captures/WEPcrack-01.cap'

Crack a WPA2 Network using Aircrack-ng
aircrack-ng -a2 -b [Target BSSID] -w /home/attacker/Desktop/Wordlist/password.txt '/home/attacker/Desktop/Sample Captures/WPA2crack-01.cap' 

	• -a is the technique used to crack the handshake, 2=WPA technique.
	• -b refers to bssid; replace with the BSSID of the target router.
	• -w stands for wordlist; provide the path to a wordlist.
